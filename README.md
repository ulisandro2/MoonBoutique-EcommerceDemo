I am delighted to share that I have completed a new project in collaboration with a friend who is also learning programming. Together, we created a Git and GitHub repository to build MoonBoutique, an ecommerce project for women's clothing based on React and with a Firebase database.

MoonBoutique serves as a virtual storefront distinguished by its elegant design. The platform offers carefully curated details, providing users with an engaging and user-friendly shopping experience.
